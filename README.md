# Timekeeper
This is the timekeeper Java program utilizing Netbeans application during the Object Oriented Programming subject back in the academe. This project scans the students' ID to generate the student details upon entry by utilizing the barcode scanner which is used for entry systems such as turnstile that is used in various establishments such as in schools and offices.

## About the program:

This timekeeper program build was widely used in establishments with turnstile (get in and out) such as schools, offices, factories, and other professional buildings.

The program used an identification system thus whenever we scan our ID the program will record the following:
- picture of the ID
- your name
- date

## Reference:

About the reference, the program for the timeKeeper was made use by using NetBeans App, an application wherein you can code the site for Java Applications.
