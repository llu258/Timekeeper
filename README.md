# Timekeeper
This is the timekeeper Java program that we made using the Netbeans App.

##About the program:
This timekeeper program we build was widely used in schools, offices, factories, and other professional buildings.

The program used an identification system (ID) thus whenever we scan our ID the program will record the following:
- picture of the ID
- your name
- date
- time of entering the establishment
